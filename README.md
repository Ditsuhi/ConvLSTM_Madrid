# Comparison of Nitrogen Dioxide predictions during a pandemic and non-pandemic scenario over Madrid city using a Convolutional LSTM network


Air pollution reduction is the focus of attention of both scientists and governments. Among the most dangerous pollutants are particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). Having information about pollution in advance can help decision-makers to apply control measurements with the aim to reduce pollution. This work concentrates on the prediction of nitrogen dioxide in Madrid city. As a machine learning technologies, ConvLSTM was applied and compared for two scenarios: pandemic (January-June 2020) and non-pandemic (January-June 2019), each with two sub-scenarios based on time granularity (6-hour and 12-hour), and dataset types (meteorological and air quality data). The Root Mean Square Error was taken as an evaluation metric, and the results showed that the pandemic period outperformed non-pandemic period, the inclusion of meteorological data produced better results, and an increase in temporal granularity resulted in a decrease in accuracy.

The dataset is available in the Zenodo repository with the following DOI:https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4734952
